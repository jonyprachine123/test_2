## Current State
The banner management system has been improved to handle both file uploads and image URLs.

### Key Components

#### Backend (server/server.js)
- Database schema updated with:
  - `image` column for uploaded files
  - `imageUrl` column for external URLs
  - Price and discount fields
- Improved error handling and logging
- Sample banner data included

#### Frontend (src/pages/AdminBanners.tsx)
- Support for both image upload and URL input
- Improved form validation

### Recent Changes
